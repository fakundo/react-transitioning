A library that provides React components for managing animations and transitions with ease. It allows seamless transitions for both individual components and groups of elements. Lightweight and has no dependencies. Inspired by [react-transition-group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) and has almost the same API.

```tsx
<FadeTransition in={visible}>
  <div>Fading element</div>
</FadeTransition>
```

## Key Features

- Built with functional components and hooks, avoiding deprecated methods like `findDOMNode`.
- Unlike `react-transition-group`, there's no need to pass a `nodeRef` prop.
- Supports both CSS-based and inline style-based transitions.
- Minimal bundle size.
- No dependencies.

## Installation

To install `react-transitioning`, run the following command in your project:

```bash
npm install react-transitioning
# or
yarn add react-transitioning
```
